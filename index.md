<!-- Data Science -->
In 2012, a year out of business college, I decided to drop everything and learn to code.
In a period of three months, I **learned to code** and **shipped my first data product**.
Since then, I've been working heavily with data.
I lead the user acquisition at a startup called PasswordBox.
The product was used by over 15 million persons and was eventually acquired by Intel in 2014.
Following the acquisition, I transitioned into data science.

With more than 5-year experience focusing on data science career path,
I have hands-on experience in solving empirical problems in the field of retail
banking industry including operation improvement and marketing,
with focus on predicting, text mining,
recommendation problems with machine learning techniques.

I am leading data teams working on data-driven projects with open-source
infrastructure and also advocating for changes.
I am specialized in translating the business problems into data-driven solutions, and weaving the gap between business and technology by on data visualization (DataViz) and persuasive presentations skills.

Right now, I am **Data Scientist / Data Manager** at Taishin International Bank in Taiwan.
Here, I document my journey learning about **data science** and **growth** all while teaching others.
