<!-- Data Science -->
In 2012, a year out of business college, I decided to drop everything and learn to code.
In a period of three months, I **learned to code** and **shipped my first data product**.
Since then, I've been working heavily with data.
I lead the user acquisition at a startup called PasswordBox.
The product was used by over 15 million persons and was eventually acquired by Intel in 2014.
Following the acquisition, I transitioned into data science.
